### Three Types Of Numbers
>
##### Integer
``` python
number_1 = 5
number_2 = -5
number_3 = 209429050423859030945804398598340958
```
###### Integers are made up of whole numbers. Postive or negative. Their size is
###### only limited to the machine they are run on and version of python you are

##### Float
``` python
number_4 = 5.5
number_5 = -5.5
number_6 = 5.249583059304829
```
###### Floats are fractional numbers that are precise up to 15 decimal points.

##### Complex
``` python
number_7 = 4+3j
# print(number_7) -> (4+3j)
```
###### In order for python to interpret complex numbers you must use a `j` or `J`.
