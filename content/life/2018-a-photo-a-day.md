I have realized something about myself that took me a long time to learn. Sometimes I don't like to do things unless I can see the road ahead. Where does this choice leave me? Why am I even trying? 

This feels like a common trait of many people I know if not everybody. I've learned that sometimes you don't need a general direction to take you anywhere. That sometimes it's best to just do something to do it. With that in mind I am going to be starting a new tradition. I have been doing it for a few days now but I feel like I can share this with all of you. 

I am going to be posting a new photo to my "professional" Instagram account every day. I'm not sure where exactly this will lead me or how it will help me but I know that if you wan't to get better at something you need to fail.

Have a wonderful day.
